# Envited Front-End Assessment Task

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Things I'd do if I had more time

- Image upload button - use image placeholder icon instead from Iconly
- Location autosuggest via Google Maps API / similar -> correct location details
- Route transitions between pages
- Make the /event page a fly-in modal
- Fade the cover image in
- Write end-to-end tests using Playwright
- Break things further into components + type the codebase more strongly

Will discuss more in interview :)
